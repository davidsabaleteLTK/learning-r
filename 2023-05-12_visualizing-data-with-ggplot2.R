# We can reduce over-plotting by adding some jitter:
ggplot(surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter())

# We can add additional aesthetic values according to other properties from our dataset. For instance, if we want to color points differently depending on the species.
ggplot(surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length, colour = species_id)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter())

# We can make the points more transparent so we can assess the overplotting.

# Just like we did for the species_id and the colors, we can do the same with using different shapes for

## Challenge
# - Create boxplot for hindfoot_length, and change the color of the points.
# - Replace the boxplot by a violin plot
# - Add the layer coord_flip()
ggplot(subset(surveys_complete, !is.na(weight)), aes(x = species_id, y = hindfoot_length)) +

  geom_point(alpha=0.3, color="tomato", position = "jitter") +
  geom_boxplot(alpha=0) + coord_flip() + facet_wrap( ~ sex)

## Challenge
# - Modify the data frame so we only look at males and females
# - Change the colors, so points for males and females are different
# - Change the data frame to only plot three species of your choosing
ggplot(subset(surveys_complete, species_id %in% c("DO", "DM", "DS") & sex %in% c("F", "M")),

# Barplot
ggplot(surveys_complete, aes(species_id)) + geom_bar()

  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = species_id, y = mean_weight)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")


## Challenge
# - Repeat the same thing on the hindfoot length instead of the weight
surveys_complete %>%
  filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length)) %>%
  group_by(species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_hindfoot = mean(hindfoot_length)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = species_id, y = mean_hindfoot)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")


# Plotting time series data
# Letâ€™s calculate number of counts per year for each species. To do that we need to group data first and count records within each group.
yearly_counts <- surveys_complete %>%
  group_by(year, species_id) %>%
  summarise(count=n())

# Timelapse data can be visualised as a line plot with years on x axis and counts on y axis.
ggplot(yearly_counts, aes(x=year, y=count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")

# This is the plot data for all the species together. We need to tell ggplot to split graphed data by species_id
ggplot(yearly_counts, aes(x=year, y=count, group=species_id)) +
  geom_line()

# We will be able to distiguish species in the plot if we add colors.
ggplot(yearly_counts, aes(x=year, y=count, group=species_id, color=species_id)) +
  geom_line()

## Challenge
# - Draw the yearly counts for the species DO, DS, DM
# - Draw the yearly counts for each plot type
# - Draw the yearly counts for all taxa but Rodents
# - Draw the yearly counts for species that have been captured more than 2000 times over the course of the surveys (difficult)
# - Draw the yearly counts for the species that have been captured at least 300 times in one year (difficult)
surveys_complete %>%
  group_by(taxa, year) %>%

surveys_complete %>%
  group_by(plot_type, year) %>%
  tally %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, group = plot_type, color = plot_type)) +
  geom_line()

### Easy
yearly_counts %>%
  filter(species_id %in% c("DO", "DS", "DM")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count, group = species_id, color = species_id)) +
  geom_line()

### Difficult
sp_totals <- surveys_complete %>%
  group_by(species_id) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  filter(count > 2000) %>%
  .$species_id

yearly_counts %>%
  filter(species_id %in% sp_totals) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count, group = species_id, color = species_id)) +
  geom_line()

### More difficult
sp_250 <- yearly_counts %>%
  filter(count >=  300) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  select(species_id) %>%
  unique

yearly_counts %>%
  filter(species_id %in% sp_250$species_id) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count, group = species_id, color = species_id)) +
  geom_line()
